            You are about to begin a quiz to test your knowledge on what you have learned already throughout the
            course of this bootcamp. You will be asked a series of 6 multiple-choice questions that are based on the
            first few weeks of this bootcamp.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a few things to keep in mind while taking this quiz; you are timed and for every question that
            you answer incorrectly, you will have a deduction on your time. Answer carefully!
            <br>
            <br>
            When you are ready, please click 'start quiz' to begin. Good luck!
