                You are about to begin a quiz to test your knowledge on what you have learned already throughout the
                course of this bootcamp. You will be asked a series of 6 multiple-choice questions that are based on the
                first few weeks of this bootcamp.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are a few things to keep in mind while taking this quiz; you are timed and for every question that
                you answer incorrectly, you will have a deduction on your time. Answer carefully!
                <br>
                <br>
                When you are ready, please click 'start quiz' to begin. Good luck!
