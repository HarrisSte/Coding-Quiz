# Contribtions

For this project, I utilized multiple resources to help me build this application from scratch. I attended an optional two-hour review session of JavaScript provided by my bootcamp instructor. The numerous resources provided by my instructor and TAs in the boot camp aided in supplementing my process of developing this project. I referenced outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with my colleagues, Andrew Zümwalt & Keiran Grant, when I ran in to an obstacle.
